	"what causes pcos": "The exact cause of PCOS is not known. Most experts think that several factors, including genetics, play a role:\n\nHigh levels of androgens. Androgens are sometimes called \"male hormones,\" although all women make small amounts of androgens. Androgens control the development of male traits, such as male-pattern baldness. Women with PCOS have more androgens than normal. Higher than normal androgen levels in women can prevent the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation) during each menstrual cycle, and can cause extra hair growth and acne, two signs of PCOS.\nHigh levels of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls how the food you eat is changed into energy. Insulin resistance is when the body's cells do not respond normally to insulin. As a result, your insulin blood levels become higher than normal. Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance, especially those who have overweight or obesity, have unhealthy eating habits, do not get enough physical activity, and have a family history of diabetes (usually type 2 diabetes). Over time, insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes.",

	"ovarian cysts, cyst": "A cyst on your ovary can be found during a pelvic exam. Depending on its size and whether it's fluid filled, solid or mixed, your doctor likely will recommend tests to determine its type and whether you need treatment. \n\nPossible tests include: \n1. Pregnancy test. A positive test might suggest that you have a corpus luteum cyst. Pelvic ultrasound. A wandlike device (transducer) sends and receives high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to create an image of your uterus and ovaries on a video screen. Your doctor analyzes the image to confirm the presence of a cyst, help identify its location and determine whether it's solid, filled with fluid or mixed. Laparoscopy. Using a laparoscope — a slim, lighted instrument inserted into your abdomen through a small incision — your doctor can see your ovaries and remove the ovarian cyst. This is a surgical procedure that requires anesthesia. \n2. Blood test. Blood levels of a protein called cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) often are elevated in women with ovarian cancer. If your cyst is partially solid and you're at high risk of ovarian cancer, your doctor might order this test. Elevated CA 125 levels can also occur in non cancerous conditions, such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids and pelvic inflammatory disease. \n\nTreatment depends on your age, the type and size of your cyst, and your symptoms. Your doctor might suggest: \n1. Watchful waiting. In many cases you can wait and be re-examined to see if the cyst goes away within a few months. This is typically an option — regardless of your age — if you have no symptoms and an ultrasound shows you have a simple, small, fluid-filled cyst. Your doctor will likely recommend that you get follow-up pelvic ultrasounds at intervals to see if your cyst changes in size. Medication. \n2. Your doctor might recommend hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, to keep ovarian cysts from recurring. However, birth control pills won't shrink an existing cyst. \n3. Surgery. Your doctor might suggest removing a cyst that is large, doesn't look like a functional cyst, is growing, continues through two or three menstrual cycles, or causes pain. Some cysts can be removed without removing the ovary (ovarian cystectomy). In some cases, your doctor might suggest removing the affected ovary and leaving the other intact (oophorectomy). \n4. If a cystic mass is cancerous, your doctor will likely refer you to a gynecologic cancer specialist. You might need to have your uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (total hysterectomy) and possibly chemotherapy or radiation. Your doctor is also likely to recommend surgery when an ovarian cyst develops after menopause.",
	"dizzy when pregnant": "During the second trimester, dizziness may be caused because your growing uterus puts pressure on blood vessels.

	"": "For most first-time moms, those early flutters, also called quickening, can happen anywhere from 18 to 22 weeks into pregnancy. “But that’s not a hard and fast rule,” says Bartos. “I actually felt my first baby move at 16 weeks—it felt like gas bubbles.” How big your baby is and the position of your uterus also play a role in when you feel those first movements. “You'll feel movement when your uterus is at the same level as your belly button and the baby is large enough, usually weighing about one pound,” explains Bartos. However, moms who've already delivered a baby often feel movements sooner, even as early as the 12-week mark. “Not only do these moms know what the sensation feels like already, but the abdominal wall of second-time moms relaxes early, allowing her to feel movement earlier, too.”\n\nIf you don't feel your baby moving by week 22, let your midwife or physician know.",

Black women are three times more likely to experience fibroids than other women.\n\nFibroids are tumors that are noncancerous in nature. These fibroids grow in the muscle tissue of the uterus. While fibroids commonly grow in the uterine wall, they can also grow outside the uterine wall or even into your uterine cavity. Women can, and often do, have more than one fibroid in their uterus at a time. Fibroids are commonly referred to as myomas or uterine leiomyomas.\n\nThe effect that uterine fibroids have on fertility varies from woman to woman. Based on various studies, it is estimated that about 5 to 10 percent of all infertile women have at least one fibroid. However, this does not necessarily mean that the fibroids caused these women to be infertile.\n\nIn general, the effect uterine fibroids have on fertility depends mostly on size and location. For example, fibroids that occur within the uterine cavity are more likely to result in infertility than fibroids that occur in other areas of the uterus. Also, fibroids in the wall of the uterus that are larger than six centimeters in diameter are also likely to cause infertility. Fortunately, large fibroids and growths that occur in the uterine cavity are uncommon.\n\nThe vast majority of women will not become infertile due to fibroids. If you suspect that fibroids are impacting your fertility, you and your partner should be thoroughly evaluated to ensure that other issues aren't the cause of infertility.",

Often, however, you can prevent or ease back pain during pregnancy.\n\nhere are some tips\n\n1. Practice good posture\nAs your baby grows, your center of gravity shifts forward. To avoid falling forward, you might compensate by leaning back — which can strain the muscles in your lower back and contribute to back pain during pregnancy. Keep these principles of good posture in mind:\n\nStand up straight and tall.\nHold your chest high.\nKeep your shoulders back and relaxed.\nDon't lock your knees.\nWhen you stand, use a comfortably wide stance for the best support. If you must stand for long periods of time, rest one foot on a low step stool — and take time for frequent breaks.\n\nGood posture also means sitting with care. Choose a chair that supports your back, or place a small pillow behind your lower back.\n\n2. Get the right gear\nWear low-heeled — not flat — shoes with good arch support. Avoid high heels, which can further shift your balance forward and cause you to fall.\n\nYou might also consider wearing a maternity support belt. Although research on the effectiveness of maternity support belts is limited, some women find the additional support helpful.\n\n3. Lift properly\nWhen lifting a small object, squat down and lift with your legs. Don't bend at the waist or lift with your back. It's also important to know your limits. Ask for help if you need it.\n\n4. Sleep on your side\nSleep on your side, not your back. Keep one or both knees bent. Consider using pregnancy or support pillows between your bent knees, under your abdomen and behind your back.\n\n5. Try heat, cold or massage\nWhile evidence to support their effectiveness is limited, massage or the application of a heating pad or ice pack to your back might help.\n\n6.

	"twins": "Here are some things that help have twins:\n\nBeing older rather than younger helps. It seems to be a twist of nature that just before a woman enters perimenopause, her ovaries start releasing more than one egg each month. This “fertility spike” is also influenced by a surge of oestrogen. \n\nHaving been pregnant before. Women who have previously had a baby or two have a higher chance of conceiving with twins.\n\nHave a big family. This theory is based on pure maths; the more times you conceive the greater the likelihood of conceiving more than one baby.\n\nBe heavier rather than lighter so that you've got a higher body mass index (BMI). Some researchers claim that a woman with a BMI of greater than 30 boosts her chances. But considering a healthy range during the fertile years is 20-25 and 30 would put you into the overweight/obese category then this is not a healthy recommendation.\n\nTake a folic acid supplement before you conceive. The general recommendation for women who are planning to conceive is to start taking folic acid supplements one month before conception.\n\nEncourage your partner to eat some oysters. The urban myth about oysters being an aphrodisiac is not entirely without basis. Oysters are high in zinc and this helps with sperm production. The more healthy and mobile his sperm are, the greater the likelihood of being able to fertilise an egg or two. If he’s keen to take supplements, the recommendation for men in their fertile years is 14 mg/day. Green leafy vegetables, cereals, bread, seeds and wheat germ are all excellent sources of zinc.\n\nEat more yams/sweet potatoes. It is a fact that more women conceive with twins who live in areas where yams are a major component of their diet. It seems that a naturally occurring chemical component of the yams helps to support ovarian function.",

	"hydrosalpinx": "A hydrosalpinx is a condition that occurs when the fallopian tube is blocked and fills with serous or clear fluid near the ovary (distal to the uterus). The blocked tube may become substantially distended giving the tube a characteristic sausage-like or retort-like shape.\n\nA common cause for distal tubal occlusion is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), usually as a consequence of an ascending infection by chlamydia or gonorrhea.\n\nPregnancy is usually only achieved with IVF.",
	"What time of day to have sex to get pregnant": "It doesn't matter what time of day you have sex when you're trying to conceive. What matters is that you're having sex a few days before and during ovulation. Just relax and have fun when the mood arises– morning, noon, or night!",
	"Sports Bra, fit , right fit, how to fit": "Choosing the right sports bra is essential for women of any size, shape or activity level. While most women athletes wear a sports bra for support and comfort, many are likely wearing the wrong size. This can result in breast pain and even soft tissue damage. It’s important to make sure you have adequate support so you can lead an active lifestyle without unnecessary discomfort. Here are some tips on getting the right fit.\n\n\nChafing: Make sure there is no chafing around the armholes, shoulder straps or seams. If the bra has hooks or snaps, make sure those don't chafe, either.\n\nStraps: You should be able to fit two fingers between the straps and your shoulders. It’s vital that the straps are secure and comfortable. If they’re too tight, they will dig in. If they’re too loose, they will not provide the correct amount of support and will move around or slip off your shoulders.\n\nBand: Raise your hands over your head. If the band rides up, it may be too big. Try adjusting the straps or back closure. If that doesn’t work, try a smaller band size.\n\nCup: Your breasts should be centered and fully contained in the cups. Scoop them in and center them. Wrinkles or puckers in the fabric indicate the cup is too big. If breast tissue is pressed outside of the bra, that means the cup is too small, or that the style of bra is the wrong cut for your breast type.\n\nSupport: Test the bra's support by jumping or running in place. Your breasts should feel secure and supported. If there’s too much movement up and down or side to side, keep looking for a better-fitting bra. \n\nDoes all of this make sense dear?"
